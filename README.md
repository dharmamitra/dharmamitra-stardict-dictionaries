# Dharmamitra StarDict Dictionaries

Automatically generated bilingual dictionaries based on parallel sentence data, provided by Dharmamitra. 

## Overview

These StarDict format dictionaries are created from parallel sentence alignments to assist in translation work for Sanskrit<>Tibetan, Sanskrit<>Chinese, and Chinese<>Tibetan. 

## Dictionaries Available

The dictionaries can be downloaded from: [dharmamitra.org/pub/dictionaries/](https://dharmamitra.org/pub/dictionaries/)

## Features

- Bilingual translations of terms and phrases automatically extracted from large sets of parallel sentence pairs
- StarDict format compatible with many dictionary applications

## Limitations
- The phrase entries of the dictionaries are automatically generated, and the boundary detection is therefore not always reliable. These are not manually curated dictionaries, so use with caution!
- The size is large with millions of entries based on more than 1.7m sentence pairs combined. The rendering can therefore be a bit slow depending on the entry size. 

## Usage

2. Install a StarDict-compatible dictionary viewer (like GoldenDict, StarDict, or SDCV)
3. Add your favorite folder with the dictionary files to your viewer
