</p>

- Bilingual translations of terms and phrases automatically extracted from large sets of parallel sentence pairs  
- StarDict format compatible with many dictionary applications  

## Limitations
- The phrase entries of the dictionaries are automatically generated, they are not manually checked and we don't claim that these are exhaustive resources. The boundary detection is not always reliable. These are not manually curated dictionaries, so use with caution!
- The size is large with millions of entries based on more than 1.7m sentence pairs combined. The rendering can therefore be a bit slow depending on the entry size.
